# User Manual

# Movement: 

This program uses basic WASD controls along with the mouse, where 'W' and 'S' move the character forward and backward while 'A' and 'D' rotate the camera left or right. 

Additionally, the mouse can be clicked and dragged to rotate the camera left or right as the player walks.

# Interacting With the World

Walls have collision, so the player must walk within the bounds. If a user attempts to walk through a wall, they will be stopped in their tracks. 

Originally, we planned to allow for "shooting" the Alien, where if the user clicked on them they would despawn, though we were not quite able to work out this functionality.

Additionally, we planned on having a working health/ammo count that would increase if the player walked through a "health pack" or "ammo" pack, but we ran out of time implementing this, even though we had a fairly good idea on how to do it. Instead, the game uses a static status bar for health and ammo that does not change.
